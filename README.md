# claude-code-telegram

Remote access to **Claude Code** over Telegram. Message a bot from your phone and it drives a real Claude Code agent on your machine — streaming the reply back live, asking for approval before it runs anything risky.

> ⚠️ **This bot can read, write, and run commands on the machine it runs on.** Access is gated only by a Telegram user-id allow-list. Keep `ALLOWED_USER_IDS` tight, and prefer running it somewhere disposable.

## Why

The usual loop for touching a server is: open a terminal, SSH in, run something, close the session. This replaces that with a chat. It's something already running on the box that knows the system — it can check on services, restart things, set up a crontab, read logs, deploy — driven from natural-language messages. When a service falls over at 2am you get a Telegram ping and fix it from your phone, no SSH client required. Read the [full write-up →](https://gyorgy.sh/blog/claude-code-telegram).

*Asking for a script, approving the write, and getting formatted code with notes back — a full task end to end.*

## Features

- **Live streaming, the native way** — uses Telegram's streaming APIs: **Rich Messages** (Bot API 10.1) and **message drafts** (Bot API 9.3) so replies stream in as an animated preview and land as cleanly formatted, structured messages. A legacy edit-in-place mode is available as a fallback. See [Streaming modes](#streaming-modes).
- **Permission-first** — nothing runs without your say-so. Read-only tools (Read/Glob/Grep…) run automatically; anything that touches the system (`Bash`/`Write`/`Edit`…) pauses for **✅ Approve · ❌ Deny · ♾️ Always allow** inline buttons. "Always allow" whitelists that tool for the rest of the session; approvals auto-deny on timeout so nothing hangs.
- **A capable, on-task personality** — smart, resourceful, and concise for a phone screen, with the occasional joke but work first, fun later. Tunable in `src/prompt.ts`.
- **Operator playbook (`work.md`)** — define how recurring jobs should be done ("restart Apache", crontab edits, deploys, schedules) once, and the bot follows your conventions every time. See [work.md](#workmd--your-operator-playbook).
- **Session continuity** — context carries across messages; `/new` resets it. Sessions (resume token, cwd, mode, allow-list, cost totals) are **persisted to disk**, so they survive a restart.
- **Git review from chat** — `/diff` shows the working-tree diff (as a `.diff` file when large) with inline **Commit / Discard** buttons; `/commit <message>` stages and commits.
- **Cost & usage tracking** — `/usage` reports turns, spend, and time for the chat (today + lifetime).
- **Working directory control** — `/cd`, `/pwd`, `/status`.
- **File send/receive** — upload files/photos (Claude *sees* images inline); Claude can send files back via a built-in `send_file` tool (images arrive as photos).
- **Quiet by default** — messages from anyone not on the allow-list are silently ignored (no reply, no trace).

## Platforms

Runs anywhere Node.js 20+ runs — **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Windows** — using the npm scripts (`npm install`, `npm run dev` / `npm run build && npm start`).

Authentication for Claude itself reuses your existing `claude` CLI login, or set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env`. Uses long polling, so no public webhook or open port is needed.

## Quick install (one-liner)

On a fresh **Linux** or **macOS** box, the wizard installs everything for you — Homebrew (macOS), Node 20+, git, and the Claude Code CLI — checks RAM (and offers to add swap on small Linux boxes), clones the repo, builds it, walks you through `.env`, and offers to set it up as a background service:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://gyorgy.sh/cct-install.sh | bash
```

You'll still need a [bot token](#setup) and your numeric user id to hand it (it prompts for both). Prefer to read before you run? The script is [`scripts/cct-install.sh`](scripts/cct-install.sh).

> The wizard is interactive — it reads your answers from the terminal even when piped through `curl`. For an unattended run, set `CCT_TOKEN`, `CCT_USER_IDS`, and `CCT_MODE=service|manual` (and `CCT_YES=1`) in the environment.

## Setup (manual)

1. **Create a bot**: message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), run `/newbot`, copy the token.
2. **Find your user id**: message [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot).
3. **Configure**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # edit .env: TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, ALLOWED_USER_IDS, WORKDIR
   ```
4. **Install & run**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev         # watch mode (reloads on change)
   # or: npm run build && npm start
   ```

## Run as a service (Linux & macOS)

For an always-on deployment, install the bot as an OS service. The same commands work on both platforms — they dispatch to **systemd** on Linux and **launchd** on macOS:

```bash
./scripts/install-service.sh        # builds, installs + starts the service
./scripts/agentctl.sh status        # start | stop | restart | status | logs
./scripts/agentctl.sh logs          # follow logs
```

- **Linux** — a systemd unit (`telegram-agent`). The installer also adds a scoped, passwordless sudoers rule for just this service.
- **macOS** — a per-user LaunchAgent (`sh.gyorgy.telegram-agent`) that runs in your login session (where the `claude` CLI login lives); no sudo needed.

Either way you can **ask the agent to restart itself** ("restart yourself" → `./scripts/agentctl.sh restart`); the management commands are documented in `work.md`. The launcher `scripts/run.sh` can also be run directly without any service manager.

### Update & uninstall

```bash
./scripts/update.sh                 # git pull + npm install + build, restarts the service if installed
./scripts/uninstall-service.sh      # remove the service (leaves the checkout, .env and data/ intact)
```

`update.sh` refuses to run with uncommitted changes and only restarts when a service is actually installed, so it's safe whether you run as a service or by hand.

```
scripts/
  cct-install.sh         # one-liner bootstrap wizard (curl | bash)
  run.sh                 # launcher (build if needed, then run)
  update.sh              # pull + rebuild + restart
  install-service.sh     # installer    → dispatches by OS
  uninstall-service.sh   # uninstaller  → dispatches by OS
  agentctl.sh            # manager       → dispatches by OS
  linux/                 # systemd implementation
  macos/                 # launchd implementation
```

## Configuration

| Variable | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | yes | Token from @BotFather |
| `ALLOWED_USER_IDS` | yes | Comma-separated numeric Telegram user ids (the allow-list) |
| `WORKDIR` | no | Directory Claude starts in (default: the gitignored `data/` folder, so agent-created files stay out of the repo) |
| `STATE_FILE` | no | Where session + usage state is persisted across restarts (default `data/state.json`) |
| `CLAUDE_MODEL` | no | Model id (default `claude-opus-4-8`) |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | no | API key; omit to use `claude` CLI login |
| `APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_MS` | no | Approval wait before auto-deny (default 300000) |
| `STREAM_MODE` | no | `rich` (default), `draft`, or `edit` — see below |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | no | `error` \| `warn` \| `info` (default) \| `debug` |
| `WORK_FILE` | no | Path to the operator playbook (default `work.md`) |

### Streaming modes

| Mode | How it streams | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rich` | Bot API 10.1 Rich Messages (`sendRichMessageDraft` → `sendRichMessage`) | Default. Structured formatting; sent as safe escaped HTML so code (`<…>`, `#`, `$`) never breaks the parser. Private chats only. |
| `draft` | Bot API 9.3 `sendMessageDraft` → `sendMessage` | Plain animated preview, finalized as a formatted message. Private chats only. |
| `edit` | Throttled `editMessageText` of a placeholder | Most battle-tested fallback; works in any chat. |

## Permissions

The bot never runs commands on its own. For every non-read-only tool call you get an inline prompt showing exactly what Claude wants to do:

- **✅ Approve** — run it once.
- **❌ Deny** — refuse it.
- **♾️ Always allow `<Tool>`** — stop asking for that tool for the rest of this session (until `/new` or a restart).

To run without prompts entirely, switch a chat to autonomous mode with `/mode auto` (and back with `/mode safe`). Read-only tools always run automatically.

## work.md — your operator playbook

`work.md` is a plain-markdown file the bot appends to Claude's system prompt **on every turn** (so edits apply instantly, no restart). Use it to define how common, recurring tasks should be done so they happen the same way each time — for example:

- "restart Apache" → the exact command and a config test first
- editing **crontab** safely (diff, back up, non-interactive install) and scheduling jobs
- deploy steps for your projects
- ground rules (confirm destructive actions, prefer non-interactive commands)

A starter template ships in `work.md`; replace the examples with what's true for your machine. Point `WORK_FILE` elsewhere to use a different file.

## Commands

| Command | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `/new` | Start a fresh conversation |
| `/cd <path>` | Change working directory |
| `/pwd` | Show current directory |
| `/status` | Show session info (cwd, model, mode, session id) |
| `/diff` | Review the working-tree diff, then commit or discard inline |
| `/commit <message>` | Stage all changes and commit |
| `/usage` | Show cost & activity for this chat (today + lifetime) |
| `/stop` | Abort the running request |
| `/mode safe\|auto` | Interactive approval (default) or autonomous |
| `/help` | Show help |

## Support & troubleshooting

- **Bot doesn't respond at all** — confirm your numeric id is in `ALLOWED_USER_IDS`; unknown users are ignored silently. Check the console logs (raise detail with `LOG_LEVEL=debug`).
- **`npm start` shows stale behavior** — `npm start` runs the compiled `dist/`; rebuild with `npm run build` first.
- **Rich formatting looks off** — try `STREAM_MODE=draft` or `STREAM_MODE=edit` in `.env`. Rich/draft modes require a **private** chat.
- **Approvals never resolve** — make sure only **one** instance is polling; two pollers split updates and cause conflicts.
